# Smartphone--tripod adapter
An adapter for fitting Nokia 808 Pureview into a standard Arca-Swiss compatible
tripod head.

## Instructions
The file arca_swiss_quick_release_plate.scad describes an Arca--Swiss
quick-release plate. It is not needed for the adapter, but rather serves as a
stand-alone example of an Arca--Swiss plate for other projects.

The adapter requires further two M6 bolts (minimum length approximately 40 mm)
and two M6 nuts. The model also allows for using nylon nuts with integrated
13-mm flange.
